Kaggle competition: Titanic Machine Learning From Disaster

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

The objective of this project is to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
